## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first time using GitHub to manage and upload my project files. I learned how to:
- Initialize a repository in my local project.
- Use commands like git add, git commit, and git push to update my repository.
- Troubleshoot issues, such as resolving divergent branches, which improved my understanding of version control.

### Continued development

Everything about this project was new to me, so I still have a lot to learn! One of the biggest takeaways from this challenge was understanding the basics of responsive design. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: A Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox) - This guide was incredibly helpful in understanding how Flexbox works and how to use it effectively for responsive layouts.
